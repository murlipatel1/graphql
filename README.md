# GraphQL API Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the documentation for our GraphQL API! GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. This documentation will help you understand how to interact with our API using GraphQL.

## Getting Started

### Endpoint

Our GraphQL endpoint is located at `https://api.example.com/graphql`.

### Authentication

To interact with our API, you'll need to include your authentication token in the headers of your requests. Add the `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`.

### Playground

We recommend using the GraphQL Playground to explore and test our API. You can access it at `https://api.example.com/graphql` in your web browser.

## Queries

GraphQL queries are used to request specific data from the API. Below is an example query to get information about a user:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

## Mutations
Mutations are used to modify data on the server. Here's an example mutation to update a user's email:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(id: "123", email: "newemail@example.com") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

This mutation updates the email of the user with ID 123 to newemail@example.com and returns the updated user information.

## Subscriptions
Subscriptions allow clients to receive real-time updates when specific events occur. For example, to listen for new messages, you can use the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  newMessage {
    id
    content
    sender {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
This subscription listens for new messages and returns the message ID, content, and sender information.

Error Handling
If there are errors in your query or mutation, the server will return a JSON response with error information. Always check the errors field in the response for details on what went wrong.

Example Error Response

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid input",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["updateUser"]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```
Certainly! Below is an extended version of the GraphQL README file with code examples for mutations, subscriptions, and error handling.

## Overview

Welcome to the documentation for our GraphQL API! GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. This documentation will help you understand how to interact with our API using GraphQL.

## Getting Started

### Endpoint

Our GraphQL endpoint is located at `https://api.example.com/graphql`.

### Authentication

To interact with our API, you'll need to include your authentication token in the headers of your requests. Add the `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`.

### Playground

We recommend using the GraphQL Playground to explore and test our API. You can access it at `https://api.example.com/graphql` in your web browser.

## Queries

GraphQL queries are used to request specific data from the API. Below is an example query to get information about a user:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
This query asks for the id, name, and email fields for a user with the ID 123.

Mutations
Mutations are used to modify data on the server. Here's an example mutation to update a user's email:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(id: "123", email: "newemail@example.com") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
``
This mutation updates the email of the user with ID 123 to newemail@example.com and returns the updated user information.

Subscriptions
Subscriptions allow clients to receive real-time updates when specific events occur. For example, to listen for new messages, you can use the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  newMessage {
    id
    content
    sender {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
This subscription listens for new messages and returns the message ID, content, and sender information.

Error Handling
If there are errors in your query or mutation, the server will return a JSON response with error information. Always check the errors field in the response for details on what went wrong.

Example Error Response
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid input",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["updateUser"]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```
In this example, the mutation to update a user failed due to invalid input, and the error message provides details on the issue.

## Conclusion
That's it! You should now have a basic understanding of how to use GraphQL with our API. Feel free to explore additional features and capabilities in the documentation.
